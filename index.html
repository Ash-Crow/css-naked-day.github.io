          <h3>Welcome to the CSS Naked Day website!</h3>

          <p>Join us for the fourth annual 2009 festivities of going nude on the web!</p>

          <h3><a id="where-is-design" class="anchor" href="#where-is-design">
            Where did my Design go?
          </a></h3>

          <p>The idea behind this event is to promote Web Standards. Plain and simple. This includes proper use of (x)html, semantic markup, a good hierarchy structure, and of course, a good 'ol play on words. It's time to show off your &lt;body&gt;.</p>

          <h3><a id="how-to-participate" class="anchor" href="#how-to-participate">
            How to participate
          </a></h3>

          <p>You can join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/css-naked-day">Google groups dedicated to CSS Naked day</a>.</p>

          <p>On April 9th, simply remove all CSS from your website, stripping it entirely of its design.</p>

          <p>You can link to this page to let your visitors know about the nudity of your website! This option is for those who feel a need to give their visitors a reference as to what's going on. This is not about getting traffic or making money. There are no ads on this site, nor will there ever be. This is about you, the people; getting naked.</p>

          <h3>Wait... isn't that 48 hours?</h3>

          <p>That's correct. CSS Naked Day lasts for one international day. Technically speaking, it will be "April 9th" somewhere in the world for 48 hours. This is to ensure that everyone's website will be publicly nude for the entire world to see at any given time during April 9.</p>

          <h3>Famous Words</h3>

          <blockquote><p>This is a fun idea, fully in line with the reasons for creating CSS in the first place. While most designers are attracted by the extra presentational capabilities, saving HTML from becoming a presentational language was probably a more important motivation for most people who participated in the beginning.</p></blockquote>
