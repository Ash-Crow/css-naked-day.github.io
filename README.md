You can [create an issue](https://github.com/css-naked-day/css-naked-day.github.io/issues/new) or [update the proper file](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-another-users-repository) to add your website(s).

**Note:** **Merge conflicts** are likely to occur if all changes are made as the last line on the list. We can limit this by using _alphabetical order_, based on your last name or the name of the website if no author is present.
